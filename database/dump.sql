1	110 In The Shade	Harvey Schmidt	Tom Jones	N. Richard Nash, Harvey Schmidt and Tom Jones explore depression-era love and hope in this musical adaptation of Nash's stage play, The Rainmaker. In the tiny town of Three Point, in the hot and drought-stricken American southwest, traveling con man Bill Starbuck promises the local farmers he can conjure some much-needed rain. Spinster Lizzie Curry, whose advances are rebuffed by Sheriff File, blossoms as she pursues a romantic relationship with the charismatic stranger.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/110-in-the-shade-original-studio-cast/194342797	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/15/43/d6/mzi.zdzosxcp.tif/1000x1000bb.jpeg
2	13	Jason Robert Brown	Jason Robert Brown	Geek. Poser. Jock. Beauty Queen. Wannabe. These are the labels that can last a lifetime. With an unforgettable rock score from Tony Award-winning composer, Jason Robert Brown, (Parade, The Last Five Years, Bridges of Madison County) 13 is a musical about fitting in – and standing out! Evan Goldman is plucked from his fast-paced, preteen New York City life and plopped into a sleepy Indiana town following his parents divorce. Surrounded by an array of simpleminded middle school students, he needs to establish his place in the popularity pecking order. Can he situate himself on a comfortable link of the food chain... or will he dangle at the end with the outcasts?!? Composed of a precocious cast, no character in 13 is older than the show's title, making it wonderful for theatre companies that feature young artists. In the Broadway production, even the band was made up of teens, which is a fantastic way to involve a diverse group of artists. The cast is comprised entirely of teenagers, but the stories that come to life here are ageless, the emotions they explore timeless, the laughter and the memories they provide priceless.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/13-original-broadway-cast-recording/1308278249	https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music118/v4/6d/8e/60/6d8e6047-1597-c6df-b996-3cbd5c08ab2b/791558441338.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
3	1776	Sherman Edwards	Sherman Edwards	The seminal event in American history blazes to vivid life in this most unconventional of Broadway hits. 1776 puts a human face on the pages of history as we see the men behind the national icons: proud, frightened, uncertain, irritable, charming, often petty and ultimately noble figures, determined to do the right thing for a fledgling nation. It's the summer of 1776, and the nation is ready to declare independence... if only our founding fathers can agree to do it! 1776 follows John Adams of Massachusetts, Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania and Thomas Jefferson of Virginia as they attempt to convince the members of the Second Continental Congress to vote for independence from the shackles of the British monarchy by signing the Declaration of Independence. 1776 is a funny, insightful and compelling drama with a striking score and legendary book. It is an extremely flexible show that can be performed with characters as written or as a concert version	https://music.apple.com/us/album/1776-original-broadway-cast-recording/358218885	https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/21/d3/18/mzi.xwrhkwix.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

Paying tribute to the infectious rhythms of Latin music throughout the ages, this spicy show serves up non-stop laughs, intoxicating melodies and a journey through love, loss, nostalgia for one's homeland and the sheer joy of song. Four young Latino men have a chance meeting at Burrito World in Omaha and discover that they share the same name! Even though their ancestral roots differ (Puerto Rico, Cuba, Mexico and the Dominican Republic), they share a common dream: to stage a show of Latin standards that puts forth a positive image to counteract Latino stereotypes.

15	A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum	Stephen Sondheim	Stephen Sondheim	Broadway's greatest farce is light, fast-paced, witty, irreverent and one of the funniest musicals ever written. A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum takes comedy back to its roots, combining situations from time-tested, 2000-year-old comedies of Roman playwright, Plautus, with the infectious energy of classic vaudeville. A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum is a nonstop laughfest in which Pseudolus, a crafty slave, struggles to win the hand of a beautiful, but slow-witted, courtesan named Philia for his young master, Hero, in exchange for freedom. The plot twists and turns with cases of mistaken identity, slamming doors and a showgirl or two. This unforgettable, hysterical musical allows a terrific ensemble of comedic actors to shine – "something for everyone, a comedy tonight!"	https://music.apple.com/us/album/funny-thing-happened-on-way-to-forum-original-broadway/463188376	https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/5a/33/9c/mzi.mutxeuwt.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

Scrooge summates his feelings of Christmas tidings and charitable giving, but he's forced to face his selfish ways when three ghosts on Christmas Eve lead him through his Past, Present and Future. Thanks to their guidance, Scrooge recognizes his faults and greets Christmas morning with a cheerful "Happy Christmas" before spending the day reconnecting and sharing love with those that mean the most to him.

Can he knock off his unsuspecting relatives without being caught and become the ninth Earl of Highhurst? And what of love? Because murder isn't the only thing on Monty's mind....

18	A Little Night Music	Stephen Sondheim	Stephen Sondheim	Sondheim creates a stunning tour de force when he takes Ingmar Bergman's comedy of manners, Smiles of a Summer Night, and turns it into a musical of masterful execution and elegance. Winner of four Tony Awards, this is a musical work that has forever entranced the world of theatre. Set in 1900 Sweden, A Little Night Music explores the tangled web of affairs centered around actress, Desirée Armfeldt, and the men who love her: a lawyer by the name of Fredrik Egerman and the Count Carl-Magnus Malcom. When the traveling actress performs in Fredrik's town, the estranged lovers' passion rekindles. This strikes a flurry of jealousy and suspicion between Desirée; Fredrik; Fredrick's wife, Anne; Desirée's current lover, the Count; and the Count's wife, Charlotte. Both men – as well as their jealous wives – agree to join Desirée and her family for a weekend in the country at Desirée's mother's estate. With everyone in one place, infinite possibilities of new romances and second chances bring endless surprises. A Little Night Music is full of hilariously witty and heartbreakingly moving moments of adoration, regret and desire. This dramatic musical celebration of love is perfect to showcase your highly trained singers with its harmonically advanced score and masterful orchestrations, and contains Sondheim's popular song, the haunting "Send in the Clowns."	https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-little-night-music-original-all-star-cast-recording/1459887119	https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music113/v4/df/20/4f/df204f93-b7cd-33d0-82e6-2cdcd863d2ac/A_Little_Night_Music_DigiMIX_cover_scan.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
19	A Little Princess	Andrew Lippa	Brian Crawley	Written by Tony-nominated composer/lyricist, Andrew Lippa (The Wild Party), and Brian Crawley (Violet), A Little Princess is based on the novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, which was honored by School Library Journal as one of the "Top 100 Chapter Books" of all time. This re-imagined version of the classic tale expands beyond the confines of Victorian England to Africa, giving the writers ample opportunity to include lively African music and dance, exotic locales like Mali and Timbuktu and creating an unforgettable journey around the world. Separated from her father and the openhearted Africans who have helped him raise her, young Sara Crewe is sent to boarding school in London. When things go badly for her there, her imaginative powers come to the rescue – helping to transform a drab institution into a place of magic and mystery. As the girl wins the affection of the other boarders, she draws the ire of Miss Minchin, the dour headmistress, who forces Sara to work as a maid when her father is reported dead, and his fortune is seized. Sara counters all of Miss Minchin's best efforts to degrade her, all the while maintaining the grace and virtue of a little princess. A Little Princess is a big show that calls for many younger female actresses, making it perfect for educational institutions. Because of its strong curriculum tie-ins, A Little Princess provides a wonderful opportunity for theatre companies to team up with schools in their area for workshops, talkbacks and more.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/little-princess-musical-original-broadway-cast-recording/1308538145	https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/2e/95/75/2e9575d4-3acd-8824-10a1-3796535ca489/791558945133.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
20	A Man of No Importance	Stephen Flaherty	Lynn Ahrens	Winner of the 2003 Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Musical, A Man of No Importance is the second successful collaboration by the team of Terrence McNally, Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty, all of whom won Tony Awards for Ragtime. Alfie Byrne is a bus driver in 1964 Dublin whose heart holds secrets that he can't share with anyone but his imagined confidante, Oscar Wilde. When he attempts to put on an amateur production of Wilde's Salome in the local church hall, he confronts the forces of bigotry and shame over a love "that dare not speak its name." But the redemptive power of theatre changes his life and brings his friends back to his side. A Man of No Importance is a rare gem in the canon of musical theatre, one that combines the depth and drama of a play with the lyricism and comedy of a musical. A tender and beautifully woven tale of love, friendship and coming to terms with who we are that is sure to move and inspire your audiences.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/man-no-importance-new-musical-original-cast-recording/183535980	https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/f1/38/89/mzi.sbywxcha.tif/1000x1000bb.jpeg

22	A New Brain	William Finn	William Finn	By the Tony Award-winning authors of Falsettos, here is an energetic, sardonic, often comical musical about a composer during a medical emergency. Gordon collapses into his lunch and awakes in the hospital, surrounded by his maritime-enthusiast lover, his mother, a co-worker, the doctor, and the nurses. Reluctantly, he had been composing a song for a children’s television show that features a frog – Mr. Bungee – and the specter of this large green character and the unfinished work haunts him throughout his medical ordeal. What was thought to be a tumor turns out to be something more operable, and Gordon recovers, grateful for a chance to compose the songs he yearns to produce.A New Brain preemiered at the Lincoln Center Theater in May of 1998 under the direction of Graciela Daniele.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-new-brain-2015-new-york-cast-recording/1079097480	https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music69/v4/43/5b/14/435b1462-4f38-8c33-465d-b302dd046c49/803607163327_cover.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

In an age when people believed the way to a man’s heart was through his stomach, the four women discover that the way to a woman’s heart is through her best friends.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-taste-of-things-to-come/1168584373	https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/a5/b0/85/a5b085c2-c245-fd6e-debd-588b31116e6e/4050538252101.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
25	A Year with Frog and Toad	Robert Reale	Willie Reale	A hit on Broadway, A Year with Frog and Toad was nominated for three Tony Awards – including Best Musical. Based on Arnold Lobel's well-loved books, and featuring a hummable score by Robert and Willie Reale, this whimsical show follows two great friends – the cheerful, popular Frog and the rather grumpy Toad – through four fun-filled seasons. Waking from hibernation in the Spring, Frog and Toad plant gardens, swim, rake leaves, go sledding and learn life lessons along the way. The two best friends celebrate and rejoice in the differences that make them unique and special. Part vaudeville, part make believe... all charm, A Year with Frog and Toad tells the story of a friendship that endures throughout the seasons. The jazzy, upbeat score of A Year with Frog and Toad bubbles with melody and wit, making it an inventive, exuberant and enchanting musical for the whole family. It is a perfect show to be performed by an ensemble group of actors and can be produced with either simple or extravagant staging and sets.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-year-with-frog-and-toad-original-cast-recording/571088394	https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/17/b8/35/17b83565-da46-e3d9-d93d-4d0e053fb651/803607041625_cover.tif/1000x1000bb.jpeg
26	Adding Machine: A Musical	Elmer Rice, Joshua Schmidt, Jason Loewith	Elmer Rice, Joshua Schmidt, Jason Loewith	Darkly comic and heartbreakingly beautiful, Adding Machine, a musical adaptation of Elmer Rice's incendiary 1923 play, tells the story of Mr. Zero, who after 25 years of service to his company is replaced by a mechanical adding machine. In a vengeful rage, he murders his boss.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/adding-machine-a-musical-world-premiere-recording/677342398	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/54/29/d8/5429d8d2-fef3-d9d4-57b7-72576fb45450/803607086527_cover.tif/1000x1000bb.jpeg
27	Adrift in Macao	Peter Melnick	Christopher Durang	Set in 1952 in Macao, China, Adrift in Macao is a loving parody of film noir movies. Everyone that comes to Macao is waiting for something, and though none of them know exactly what that is, they hang around to find out.\r\nThe characters include your film noir standards, like Laureena, the curvaceous blonde, who luckily bumps into Rick Shaw, the cynical surf and turf casino owner her first night in town. She ends up getting a job singing in his night club – perhaps for no reason other than the fact that she looks great in a slinky dress. And don't forget about Mitch, the American who has just been framed for murder by the mysterious villain McGuffin.\r\nWith songs and quips, puns and farcical shenanigans, this musical parody is bound to please audiences of all ages.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/adrift-in-macao-the-new-musical/1144266585	https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/37/65/f0/3765f044-0aca-37d2-67e7-e247070f49a7/191018069568.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
28	Aida	Elton John	Tim Rice	Winner of four 2000 Tony Awards, Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida is an epic tale of love, loyalty and betrayal, chronicling the love triangle between Aida, a Nubian princess stolen from her country, Amneris, an Egyptian princess, and Radames, the soldier they both love. An enslaved Nubian princess, Aida, finds her heart entangled with Radames, an Egyptian soldier who is betrothed to the Pharaoh's daughter, Amneris. As their forbidden love blossoms, Aida is forced to weigh her heart against the responsibility that she faces as the leader of her people. Aida and Radames' love for one another becomes a shining example of true devotion that ultimately transcends the vast cultural differences between their warring nations, heralding a time of unprecedented peace and prosperity. With an unforgettable score, featuring soaring ballads and rousing choral numbers, Aida is a modern crowd-pleaser that embraces multicultural casting and exuberant dancing, staging and singing for large cast sizes.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/aida-original-broadway-cast-recording/1440760777	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music118/v4/17/bf/1a/17bf1af2-8e2a-a22a-fdb5-7d81185717df/00050086067176.rgb.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpg
29	Ain't Misbehavin'	Thomas "Fats" Waller	Various	Assembled under the expert eye of director/lyricist, Richard Maltby, Jr., Ain't Misbehavin' is one of the most popular, well-crafted revues of all time and winner of the 1978 Tony Award for Best Musical. The inimitable Thomas "Fats" Waller rose to international fame during the Golden Age of the Cotton Club and that jumpin' new beat, swing music. Although not quite a biography, Ain't Misbehavin' evokes the delightful humor and infectious energy of this American original as a versatile cast struts, strums and sings the songs that he made famous in a career that ranged from uptown clubs to downtown Tin Pan Alley to Hollywood and concert stages in the U.S., Canada and Europe. Featuring five triple-threat actors and a unit set, Ain't Misbehavin' provides the perfect opportunity to deliver a smash hit while minimizing resources. The intoxicating music of Fats Waller will delight and energize audiences as well as provide great insight into a vibrant time in American history and music.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/aint-misbehavin-original-broadway-cast-recording/259887033	https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/55/97/ce/mzi.zvugmpjk.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
30	Allegro	Richard Rodgers	Oscar Hammerstein II	This ensemble musical chronicles nearly four decades in the life of an Everyman, Joseph Taylor, Jr., from cradle through a mid-life discovery of who he is and what his life is truly about. The first musical to be staged by a director who was also the choreographer (the legendary Agnes de Mille), the unique structural format allows the saga to whisk us from Joe's birth through his childhood, from college dorm to marriage altar, and on to his career; from the tranquility of his small Midwestern hometown to the hectic din of big city life, in a series of vignettes and musical sequences dazzling in their simplicity and stunning in their impact. Ahead of its time theatrically, Allegro remains timeless in its appeal.Allegro opened on Broadway at the Majestic Theatre on Ocotber 10, 1947, featuring John Battles as Joseph Taylor, Jr., Annamary Dickey asMajorie Taylor, William Ching as Dr. Joseph Taylor, Roberta Jonay as JennieBrinker, Lisa Kirk as Emily, and John Conte as Charlie Townsend.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/allegro-original-cast-recording/272741532	https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/2d/c1/3d/dj.kljeztki.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

That is, until he finds out about "The Squip," a tiny supercomputer that promises to bring him everything he desires most: a date with Christine, an invite to the raddest party of the year and a chance to survive life in his suburban New Jersey high school. But is being the most popular guy in school worth the risk?

38	Annie	Charles Strouse	Martin Charnin	Based on the popular comic strip by Harold Gray, Annie has become a worldwide phenomenon and was the winner of seven Tony Awards, including Best Musical. The beloved book and score by Tony Award winners, Thomas Meehan, Charles Strouse and Martin Charnin, features some of the greatest musical theatre hits ever written, including "Tomorrow." With equal measures of pluck and positivity, little orphan Annie charms everyone's hearts despite a next-to-nothing start in 1930s New York City. She is determined to find the parents who abandoned her years ago on the doorstep of a New York City Orphanage that is run by the cruel, embittered Miss Hannigan. With the help of the other girls in the Orphanage, Annie escapes to the wondrous world of NYC. In adventure after fun-filled adventure, Annie foils Miss Hannigan's evil machinations... and even befriends President Franklin Delano Roosevelt! She finds a new home and family in billionaire, Oliver Warbucks, his personal secretary, Grace Farrell, and a lovable mutt named Sandy. Annie is the perfect family-friendly musical and an ideal show for a largely female cast.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/annie-original-broadway-cast-recording/939941788s	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music3/v4/17/02/b4/1702b439-8c76-bd7d-6a8a-c31dda89e81e/886444963183.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
39	Annie Get Your Gun	Irving Berlin	Irving Berlin	Annie Oakley is the best shot around, and she manages to support her little brother and sisters by selling the game she hunts. When she's discovered by Col. Buffalo Bill, he persuades this novel sharpshooter to join his Wild West Show. It only takes one glance for her to fall head over heels for dashing shooting ace Frank Butler, who headlines the show. She soon eclipses Butler as the main attraction which, while good for business, is bad for romance. Butler hightails it off to join a rival show, his bruised male ego leading the way, but is ultimately pitted against Annie in a final shoot-out. The rousing, sure-fire finale hits the mark every time in a testament to the power of female ingenuity.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/annie-get-your-gun-music-theater-lincoln-center-cast/261151705	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/67/fd/75/dj.scdzmoqt.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
40	Anyone Can Whistle	Stephen Sondheim	Stephen Sondheim	Anyone Can Whistle, an absurdist social satire about insanity and conformity (among a dozen other things) is probably the bravest show that Stephen Sondheim wrote, at least until Assassins. A legendary cult show, this wacky, intelligent, highly unconventional musical points ahead to Stephen Sondheim's groundbreaking work in the 1970s, even as it keeps a foot firmly rooted in musical theatre's "golden age." Anyone Can Whistle tells the story of a corrupt mayoress who fakes a miracle to revitalize her bankrupt town (through the resulting pilgrim trade) and the ill-fated romance between the rational nurse, out to expose the fraud, and the easygoing doctor who is determined to enjoy the chaos that it brings. In the end, the show delivers a poignant message about the importance of the individual in a conformist society – but not before aiming its still-relevant barbs at government, religion, science and anything else that stands in its way! With its circus-like atmosphere, Anyone Can Whistle features plenty of memorable, lovably cartoonish roles of all sizes. The dazzling, melodic Broadway-style score overflows with the youthful energy of experimentation, consisting of one showstopper after another, including two extensive ballets that provide opportunities for some inspired choreography.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/anyone-can-whistle-broadway-cast-recording-bonus-track/204122957	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/0f/dd/f5/mzi.tsykpcyo.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

The genius of Yeston's songs – comedic yet emotional, cerebral yet romantic, clever yet unendingly melodic – makes for a memorable evening showcasing the myriad sides of the writer's repertoire. Showstoppers from Nine, Grand Hotel, Titanic, Phantom and Death Takes a Holiday intertwine with premieres of new songs from the Yeston songbook to show off his immense breadth of style – from the hilarious to the deeply moving.Anything Can Happen In The Theater: The Musical World Of Maury Yeston was first performed at The Triad in New York City in October 2017. The show premiered Off-Broadway at the York Theatre on November 26, 2019, under the direction of Gerard Alessandrini.

43	Archy & Mehitabel	George Kleinsinger	Joe Darion	Featuring a book by Joe Darion and comic legend, Mel Brooks, and a "cool" jazz score that remains one of the only examples of this genre in the commercial theatre, Archy & Mehitabel is one of the most daring musicals of its time. This off-beat musical has appeared in almost every form, including a record, a concert, a Broadway musical, a television special and, eventually, a film. In a deserted office, a cockroach dives headfirst onto the keys of a typewriter, pouring out the ruminations of his soul. It's "archy" (he's too small to hold down the shift key), poet, philosopher, moralist and futile worshipper of "mehitabel," the alley cat. This bizarre, highly original musical takes us into the streets of the big city as archy tries hopelessly to bring the "toujours gai" mehitabel off the back fence and into a respectable home as a housecat. Versatile actors play the various urbane, non-human city dwellers that we encounter along the way, suggesting their animal characteristics without explicit costumes. Designers will have a field day with the unit set of oversized props and set pieces. A true gem of the golden age, Archy & Mehitabel is a show not to be overlooked.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/archy-mehitabel-back-alley-opera-studio-cast-recording/451804179	https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/ba/70/e5/mzi.tbrcmads.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

45	Assassins	Stephen Sondheim	Stephen Sondheim	A multiple Tony Award-winning theatrical tour-de-force, Assassins combines Sondheim's signature blend of intelligently stunning lyrics and beautiful music with a panoramic story of our nation's culture of celebrity and the violent means some will use to obtain it, embodied by America's four successful and five would-be presidential assassins. Bold, original, disturbing and alarmingly funny, Assassins is perhaps the most controversial musical ever written. Assassins lays bare the lives of nine individuals who assassinated or tried to assassinate the President of the United States, in a one-act historical "revusical" that explores the dark side of the American experience. From John Wilkes Booth to Lee Harvey Oswald, writers, Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman, bend the rules of time and space, taking us on a nightmarish roller coaster ride in which assassins and would-be assassins from different historical periods meet, interact and inspire each other to harrowing acts in the name of the American Dream.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/assassins-the-2004-broadway-revival-cast-recording/881212225	https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music4/v4/7c/c1/6b/7cc16b11-f369-a355-56f8-e6bdf98608d7/803607042127_cover.tif/1000x1000bb.jpeg
46	Avenue Q	Robert Lopez, Jeff Marx	Robert Lopez, Jeff Marx	Winner of the Tony "Triple Crown" for Best Musical, Best Score and Best Book, Avenue Q is part flesh, part felt and packed with heart. The laugh-out-loud musical tells the timeless story of a recent college grad named Princeton, who moves into a shabby New York apartment all the way out on Avenue Q. He soon discovers that, although the residents seem nice, it's clear that this is not your ordinary neighborhood. Together, Princeton and his new-found friends struggle to find jobs, dates and their ever-elusive purpose in life. Filled with gut-busting humor and a delightfully catchy score, not to mention puppets, Avenue Q is a truly unique show that has quickly become a favorite for audiences everywhere. Although the show addresses humorous adult issues, it is similar to a beloved children's show; a place where puppets are friends, Monsters are good and life lessons are learned.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/avenue-q-original-broadway-cast-recording/255954505	https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/6f/57/13/dj.fkhworcs.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
47	Babes in Arms (Guare Version)	Richard Rodgers	Lorenz Hart	In this John Guare adaptation of the classic Rodgers and Hart musical, Valentine and his teenage friends find themselves unsupervised while their folks hit the vaudeville summer circuit. The local sheriff, regarding the kids as indolent loafers, threatens to send them to a work farm. But the determined kids talk the sheriff into a two-week reprieve — just enough time to produce their own show and prove their mettle. The old-fashioned virtues of this early musical comedy are peppered with socio-political issues and a sophisticated jocularity, maintaining the show's delights more than eight decades after its creation.The 1959 adaptation by George Oppenheimer is also available.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/babes-in-arms-studio-cast-recording-1951/475882086	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/06/e8/c4/mzi.emrsjgmz.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

Whether you were in the band, on the team or in the stands, you'll recognize the woes and revel in the fun of Band Geeks.

50	Barnum	Cy Coleman	Michael Stewart	P.T. Barnum, the Greatest Showman on Earth, combines razzle-dazzle with charm and brass to sell “humbug” to cheering crowds.

61	Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson	Michael Friedman	Michael Friedman	A.J. kicked British butt, shafted the Indians and smacked down the Spaniards, all in the name of these United States — who cares if he didn't have permission? Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson creators, Michael Friedman (Love's Labour's Lost, The Fortress of Solitude) and Alex Timbers (Love's Labour's Lost, Peter and the Starcatcher), cook up an alternate universe (and draw parallels to today's political/populist landscape) with their musical about the seventh U.S. president. Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson follows America's seventh president from his early days as a child on the wild frontier to his controversial reign in the White House. With the country divided into rich and poor (and with continued skirmishes with the Native Americans upsetting pieces of the new world), Jackson begins his steady climb from military strategist to populist rabble-rouser to President of the United States. Along the way, he meets his wife, Rachel, takes on the Founding Fathers — and rocks like no political figure has ever rocked before, with the help of an onstage trio and an entourage of singing, joking cohorts. It also asks the question: is wanting to have a beer with someone reason enough to elect him? What if he's really, really hot? With a raucous blend of outrageous comedy, anarchic theatricality and an infectious rock score, this wildly entertaining 90-minute show is perfect for comedic actors and singers, with minimal dancing required. Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson is an actor-driven, rather than design-dependent, musical; it encourages breaking the fourth wall, audience participation and rocking out!	https://music.apple.com/us/album/bloody-bloody-andrew-jackson-original-cast-recording/1303837291	https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music118/v4/ce/e8/e1/cee8e12d-e174-b2e2-6b9a-b91de5f303bd/791558444339.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

An idealistic young King Arthur hopes to create a kingdom built on honor and dignity, embodied by his Knights of The Round Table.  His Ideals, however are tested when his lovely queen, Guenevere, falls in love with the young Knight, Lancelot and the fate of the kingdom hangs in the balance.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/camelot-original-1960-broadway-cast-recording/158476378	https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/b5/34/43/dj.fwnabeui.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
76	Candide (1999 Version)	Leonard Bernstein	John Latouche, Richard Wilbur	A score by legendary Leonard Bernstein is but the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Candide and its theatrical offerings. With a book from Hugh Wheeler and lyrical contributions from the incomparable Stephen Sondheim, Candide is a masterpiece for the ages. Candide – the bastard cousin of Baron Thunder-Ten-Tonck – is expelled from home, dragged into the Bulgarian army, brought before the Spanish Inquisition, swindled out of a fortune, shipwrecked on a desert isle and separated time and again from his true love, Cunegonde. She, too, bears a barrage of misfortunes, including – but not limited to – sale into prostitution, forced marriage to an exorbitantly wealthy man and slavery. Through it all, however, they try remember the lessons of their dear master, Dr. Pangloss: "Everything is for the best in this best of all possible worlds." Elements of the original 1953 version – along with songs that had been dropped, rewritten or re-conceived – have been added or altered in this version in an effort to create a slightly reimagined version of the classic Candide. This version requires a large ensemble with a strong female lead. It is the perfect opportunity to showcase your trained singers of varying ages.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/candide-original-broadway-cast-recording/158824188	https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/81/22/25/mzi.jpszpgfd.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

Fickle and flirtatious, Carmen manages to steal Joe away from his fiancée, and the army as well, and they run off to Chicago together. But Carmen loses interest in Joe when she meets and successfully woos Husky Miller, a prize fighter on his way to the top. Mad with jealousy, Joe waits for Carmen outside the stadium the night of Husky's big fight to make a last desperate plea for her love.

90	City of Angels	Cy Coleman	David Zippel	In the late 1940s, Stine, a bookish writer of detective stories, struggles to adapt his crime novel into a workable screenplay. As Stine tries to maintain some integrity in the backstabbing world of Hollywood, his protagonist, a hardboiled private eye named Stone, fights for survival in a city full of criminals and opportunists. In a clever design choice, the stories are told on a split stage: Stine’s world is in full color, while Stone’s appears in black and white. With wit, humor, and a fantastic Cy Coleman score, City of Angels captures the snappy dialogue of a Raymond Chandler novel and the glitzy showmanship of classic Hollywood; the result is a crowd-pleasing musical unlike any other.City of Angels opened on Broadway at the Virginia Theatre on December 11, 1989, starring Gregg Edelman, James Naughton, Kay McClelland and Randy Graff.

Each song is a unique story told by a new character, taking audiences, not only into the songbook of Mr. Maltby and Mr. Shire, but into the minds of the individuals facing these completely relatable challenges. A superb choice for companies that have previously produced the work of Maltby and Shire, Closer Than Ever will inspire audiences to pause for self-reflection, whether presented as a fully realized production or a simple concert piece.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/closer-than-ever-original-off-broadway-cast-recording/334854621	https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/af/97/eb/mzi.tnvsnfbj.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

Based on the cult classic, 1990 John Waters film, Cry-Baby features a delightfully demented book from the writers of Hairspray and a rockabilly score from the co-founder of Fountains of Wayne and the executive producer of "The Daily Show." It's 1954. Everyone likes Ike, nobody likes communism and Wade "Cry-Baby" Walker is the coolest boy in Baltimore. He's a bad boy with a good cause – truth, justice and the pursuit of rock and roll. Cry-Baby and the square rich girl, Allison, are star-crossed lovers at the center of this world. Fueled by hormones and the new rhythms of rock and roll, she turns her back on her squeaky clean boyfriend, Baldwin, to become a "drape" (a Baltimore juvenile delinquent) and Cry-Baby's moll. At the other end of the topsy-turvy moral meritocracy of 1954 America, Baldwin is the king of the squares and leads his close-harmony pals against the juvenile delinquents, who are ultimately arrested for arson, sending the drapes all off to prison. It's Romeo and Juliet meets High School Hellcats.

97	Cyrano	Michael J. Lewis	Anthony Burgess	Edmond Rostand's classic love story, Cyrano de Bergerac, has captivated the romantic in us all for more than a century, inspiring countless stage and film adaptations of the immortal tale, including this spectacular 1973 Broadway version of Cyrano, with book and lyrics by the pre-eminent translator of Rostand's masterpiece. A phenomenal swordsman, a born leader and an artistic, intelligent poet with the ability to enchant the hardest of souls, Cyrano is plagued with one tragic flaw – a nose that is bigger than can ever be imagined. He never comes to terms with his looks or how he thinks he appears to the woman whom he secretly loves, the beautiful Roxana; thus, when she tells him of her interest in the handsome yet inarticulate soldier, Christian, Cyrano helps the young man, acting as his muse and penning eloquent love letters that win her over. A lavish addition to any season with soaring ballads and rousing word- and sword-play, Cyrano is an ideal star vehicle to boot. Christopher Plummer won the Tony Award in 1974 for his portrayal of the legendary swordsman.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/cyrano-original-1973-broadway-cast-recording/1452552975	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music114/v4/b5/73/bb/b573bb0a-9903-1bb6-e4e0-8b29f184cf5e/00075021037380.rgb.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

Jerusha Abbott is the “Oldest Orphan in the John Grier Home” until a mysterious benefactor decides to send her to college to be educated as a writer. Required to write him a letter once a month, she is never to know the benefactor’s identity – so she invents one for him: Daddy Long Legs. Although she knows that he will never respond to her letters, she grows more and more fond of this elusive and kindly “old” gentleman. But another relationship soon begins to develop in Jerusha’s life. Jervis Pendleton is the well-do-do, “youngish” uncle of one of Jerusha’s roommates, who introduces her to a world of literature, travel and adventure. Through her correspondence with Daddy Long Legs and her growing intimacy with Jervis, Jerusha’s letters chronicle her emergence as a delightfully independent “New American Woman.” Yet, there is one startling fact that Jerusha has yet to uncover – a fact that will change her life forever. This charming two-hander filled with soaring melodies is a wonderful choice for college programs and community theatres with a sophisticated audience base.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/daddy-long-legs-original-off-broadway-cast-recording/1306104645	https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music118/v4/64/e0/e8/64e0e849-9249-21d4-1087-a02d4d21baf4/791558449532.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

Head "greaser" Danny Zuko and new (good) girl Sandy Dumbrowski try to relive the high romance of their "Summer Nights" as the rest of the gang sings and dances its way through such songs as "Greased Lightnin", "It's Raining on Prom Night", "Alone at the Drive-In Movie" recalling the music of Buddy Holly, Little Richard, and Elvis Presley that became the soundtrack of a generation. An eight-year run on Broadway and two subsequent revivals, along with innumerable school and community productions place Grease among the world's most popular musicals.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/grease-new-broadway-cast-recording/264542138	https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/33/93/4b/mzi.celjrsdx.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpg

This high-octane show includes every song from Green Day's album, American Idiot, as well as several songs from its follow-up release, 21st Century Breakdown. Johnny, Tunny and Will struggle to find meaning in a post-9/11 world. When the three disgruntled men flee the constraints of their hometown for the thrills of city life, their paths are quickly estranged when Tunny enters the armed forces, Will is called back home to attend to familial responsibilities, and Johnny's attention becomes divided by a seductive love interest and a hazardous new friendship. An energy-fueled rock opera, American Idiot, features little dialogue and instead relies on the lyrics from Green Day's groundbreaking album to execute the story line. American Idiot is a high-concept show with strong social messages and endless creative possibilities. It will surely add an enticing edge to any theatre's season.

Initially in disbelief, Phil finally accepts he is doomed to repeat the same day over and over again....	https://music.apple.com/us/album/groundhog-day-musical-original-broadway-cast-recording/1215389487	https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/c2/85/aa/c285aae7-9af1-6f3d-cacc-ce22cea8daef/886446408705.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

157	Guys and Dolls	Frank Loesser	Frank Loesser	Considered by many to be the perfect musical comedy, Guys and Dolls ran for 1,200 performances when it opened on Broadway in 1950. It received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics and won a bevy of awards, including Tony Awards, Drama Desks and Oliviers. Frequently revived, the show has been done with numerous all-star casts, including productions/concerts featuring Ewan McGregor, Jane Krakowski, Brian Stokes Mitchell and Jessica Biel. Set in Damon Runyon's mythical New York City, Guys and Dolls is an oddball romantic comedy. Gambler, Nathan Detroit, tries to find the cash to set up the biggest craps game in town while the authorities breathe down his neck; meanwhile, his girlfriend and nightclub performer, Adelaide, laments that they've been engaged for fourteen years. Nathan turns to fellow gambler, Sky Masterson, for the dough, and Sky ends up chasing the straight-laced missionary, Sarah Brown, as a result. Guys and Dolls takes us from the heart of Times Square to the cafes of Havana, Cuba, and even into the sewers of New York City, but eventually everyone ends up right where they belong. Frank Loesser's brassy, immortal score makes Guys and Dolls a crowd pleaser. The large cast features both a variety of ensemble and star roles. With a great collection of production resources from MTI, this highly producible show is a treat for audiences and performers of any age.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/guys-and-dolls-new-broadway-cast-recording-1992/258638090	https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/62/ec/48/dj.jhujaxzk.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

By signing below, you agree to inform the director of your production of the casting requirements and that such use of make-up is strictly prohibited. In the past, performance licenses for Hairspray did not include this provision.

Along the way, he meets other animals and discovers how the mysteries of their phenomenon came to be.

As luck would have it, a last-minute realization stays the Wazir's hand and saves The Poet's. The wild ride continues as The Poet's daughter falls in love with the handsome Caliph, The Poet falls in love with one of the Wazir's concubines and everyone falls in love with the whirlwind of occurrences that could only happen on an Arabian Night!

208	Kurt Vonnegut's God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater	Alan Menken	Howard Ashman, Dennis Green	Kurt Vonnegut's God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is an outrageous and savagely funny fantasy about people, their pleasures, pains and perversions, a penetrating satire on insanity – a millionaire's private lunacy. Featuring an infectious score by the Oscar- and Tony-winning team of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, Little Shop of Horrors), God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is a legendary collaboration between one of America's greatest novelists and the songwriting team behind some of the greatest hits of all time. Eliot Rosewater, drunk, volunteer fireman and president of the fabulously rich Rosewater Foundation, is about to attempt a noble experiment with human nature, with a little help from writer, Kilgore Trout. The result is Vonnegut's funniest satire, an etched-in-acid portrayal of the greed, hypocrisy and follies of the flesh to which we are all heir. Any fan of the music of Menken and Ashman will delight in producing this gem, which marked the first collaboration for the two. Full of unforgettable characters and a rich and hysterically funny story, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is a perfect choice for theatres that are looking for hidden greats of musical theatre. Alan Menken speaks about his work: "Of all the musicals I've composed scores for in my career God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is probably closest and dearest to my heart..." "... It was my very first commercially produced musical and, more importantly, my first collaboration with Howard Ashman. Adapted from Kurt Vonnegut's novella, it tells the story of Elliot Rosewater, the eccentric head of the Rosewater Foundation, son of Senator Rosewater, descendant of generations of wealthy and powerful Rosewater's, who finds in the poor and forgotten Americans in Rosewater Township, Indiana, the very people who most deserve his foundation's generosity. And that story struck a deep chord in both Howard and me. The fact that Kurt Vonnegut himself became creatively involved in our little musical was a total dream-come-true. If you look (and listen) carefully, the seeds of our later work are all over this musical. It was the cradle from which we emerged to write Little Shop of Horrors, The Little Mermaid and Aladdin . We lost Howard Ashman way too soon, or that list of titles would have been much longer. That makes it all the more meaningful to me that, nearly 40 years after its creation, God Bless You Mr Rosewater now joins those other titles out in the world."	https://music.apple.com/us/album/kurt-vonneguts-god-bless-you-mr-rosewater-premiere/1256577240	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music117/v4/23/e8/a3/23e8a348-5d60-55a3-04c3-e4e46a95cee6/791558451139.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

He breaks his parole in hopes of starting a new life, initiating a lifelong struggle for redemption as he is relentlessly pursued by police inspector Javert, who refuses to believe that Valjean can change his ways. Finally, during the Paris student uprising of 1832, Javert must confront his ideals after Valjean spares his life and saves that of the student revolutionary who has captured the heart of Valjean's adopted daughter. His world view shattered, Javert commits suicide, and Valjean finally attains the peace that he has sought for so long. Epic, grand and uplifting, Les Misérables packs an emotional wallop that has thrilled audiences all over the world. The sung-through pop opera is ideal for a cast of exceptional singers and overflows with melodies that are already standards. A spectacle on Broadway and in London, Les Misérables is equally effective with a minimal set; it is its powerful affirmation of the human spirit that has made Les Misérables a popular masterpiece.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/les-miserables-the-original-london-cast-recording/1278417429	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music118/v4/2e/19/02/2e1902c8-18e0-fdb9-bbea-a702d9960fee/191773664817.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

Young Marcel, the hero, irrationally believes that Albertine is having lesbian affairs while older Marcel (played by a different actor), reflects on this seminal period in his young life interacting with himself at 17. Simple lullabies and children's songs reflecting Marcel's childish character before his affair are juxtaposed with operatic dirges, capturing the tragic effect of his self-inflicted destruction of happiness. This fascinating play preserves both the essence and themes of Proust's work.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/my-life-albertine-original-off-broadway-cast-recording/1202586817	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/18/89/d8/1889d815-85e0-f6b8-d66a-4aa846f7901c/803607021320_cover.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

The 1921 classic is brought to colorful turn-of-the--century New York in this solid star vehicle that blends the moving tenderness of the original play with appealing melodies and infectious dances. An old Swedish sailor is overjoyed when his daughter, Anna, visits him after fifteen years of living in St. Paul. His crony, Marthy, realizes that she is not the sweet innocent whom her father imagines, though, but rather a former streetwalker who's come back to reassemble the pieces of her shattered life.

268	Oil City Symphony	Various	Various	The auditorium has been swept. The crepe paper has been hung. Four music stands sit on an improvised stage. From the creators of Pump Boys and Dinettes comes the knee-slapping and award-winning revue, Oil City Symphony, the story of four graduates who return to their alma mater to honor their beloved music teacher. Remember… it's hip to be square. The four musicians of Oil City High are proud, eager – not necessarily gifted – and slightly competitive. Performing a bizarre program that ranges from the "1812 Overture" to "The Stars and Stripes Forever" to rock standards, sentimental favorites and off-beat original songs, the four fill their tribute concert with good old-fashioned fun that even includes an audience-participatory rendition of "The Hokey-Pokey," and punch and cookies. Easy and economical to produce, Oil City Symphony is a knee-slapping, sweetly nutty tribute that's an ideal showcase for four charismatic actor-singer-musicians.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/oil-city-symphony-original-cast-recording/40743359	https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/y2005/m01/d02/h10/s05.ffwcxzny.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

Richard Rodgers	Oscar Hammerstein II	Rodgers and Hammerstein’s first collaboration remains, in many ways, their most innovative, setting the standards and rules of modern musical theatre. In a Western territory just after the turn of the 20th century, a high-spirited rivalry between local farmers and cowboys provides a colorful background for Curly, a charming cowboy, and Laurey, a feisty farm girl, to play out their love story. Their romantic journey, as bumpy as a surrey ride down a country road, contrasts with the comic exploits of brazen Ado Annie and hapless Will Parker in a musical adventure embracing hope, determination and the promise of a new land.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/oklahoma-2019-broadway-cast-recording/1466325624	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music123/v4/f5/76/b3/f576b38f-c4c0-b342-74ce-411e53517c95/19UMGIM48315.rgb.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

He appears to her in the body of her absent husband and quickly wins her love. Things go swimmingly until the real Amphitryon shows up.

277	Once on This Island	Stephen Flaherty	Lynn Ahrens	From the Tony Award-winning songwriting team of Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty (Seussical, Ragtime), comes the Olivier Award-winning Once on This Island. This highly original and theatrical Caribbean adaptation of the popular fairy tale, The Little Mermaid, garnered eight Tony nominations for its Broadway run, including Best Musical, Book and Score. Ti Moune, a peasant girl, rescues a wealthy boy from the other side of the island, Daniel, with whom she falls in love. Unbeknownst to Ti Moune, the pompous gods who preside over the island make a bet with one another over which is stronger, love or death, the stakes being Ti Moune's life. When she pursues Daniel, who has returned to his people, Ti Moune is shunned because of her lowly status. Her determination and capacity to love, though, is not enough to win Daniel's heart, and Ti Moune pays the ultimate price; but the gods turn Ti Moune into a tree that grows so strong and so tall, it breaks the wall that separates the societies and ultimately unites them. Once on This Island's small band, minimal set requirements and flexibly sized cast make it a producer and director's dream. It possesses such a strong, emotional backbone that it can stand tall, from the grandest to most modest of scales. A comprehensive and informative study guide created for the 2017 Broadway Revival.

278	Once Upon a Mattress	Mary Rodgers	Marshall Barer	Many moons ago in a far-off place, Queen Aggravain decreed no couples could marry until her son, Prince Dauntless, found a bride. Princesses came from far and wide to win the hand of the prince, but none could pass the impossible tests given to them by the Queen. That is, until the “shy” swamp princess, Winnifred the Woebegone, showed up. Would she be able to pass the Sensitivity Test, marry her prince and help Lady Larkin and Sir Harry to the altar? Carried on a wave of wonderful songs, by turns hilarious and raucous, romantic and melodic, this rollicking spin on the classic tale The Princess and the Pea provides some side-splitting shenanigans. For after all, a princess is a delicate thing.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/once-upon-a-mattress-new-broadway-cast-recording-1996/937187570	https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music3/v4/17/55/d5/1755d598-5062-3d40-3d2f-5a40f179ccf2/884977032635.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
279	Ordinary Days	Adam Gwon	Adam Gwon	From one of musical theatre's most exciting new composers comes Ordinary Days, a refreshingly honest and funny musical about making real connections in the city that never sleeps (but probably should at some point).Ordinary Days tells the story of four young New Yorkers whose lives intersect as they search for fulfillment, happiness, love, and cabs. Through a score of vibrant and memorable songs, their experiences ring startlingly true to life. Ordinary Days is an original musical for anyone who's ever struggled to appreciate the simple things in a complex place. With equal doses of humor and poignancy, it celebrates how 8.3 million individual stories combine in unexpected ways to make New York City such a unique and extraordinary home.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/ordinary-days-original-cast-recording/1306108152	https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music118/v4/a1/b1/ca/a1b1ca4c-34ed-b457-1955-5d15ba14757f/791558944433.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

The two fall in love but middle class Victorian morality parts them until... Pacific 1860 features one of Coward's most attractive scores, written for the show that starred Mary Martin and re-opened Drury Lane after World War II, but never heard in the U.S.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/pacific-1860-original-london-cast/254022365	https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/f9/da/62/mzi.argohpgv.tif/1000x1000bb.jpeg
282	Pacific Overtures	Stephen Sondheim	Stephen Sondheim	Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman (authors of Assassins) mix elements of Kabuki theatre with the conventions of the Broadway musical in Pacific Overtures, a highly original, inventive, powerful, educational and surprisingly humorous theatrical experience. Considered by many to be the artistic pinnacle of the legendary Sondheim/Prince collaborations, this exploration of culture and imperialism pushes the boundaries of musical theatre further than ever before. Commodore Matthew Perry's 1853 mission to open trade relations with isolationist Japan through gunboat diplomacy forges an unlikely friendship between the samurai, Kayama, and the Americanized fisherman, Manjiro. Kayama and Manjiro – and all of Japanese society – must face the wave of Westernization that follows. Its epic scope, ethnic cast and subject matter, and sheer ambition make Pacific Overtures a unique and worthwhile effort for any theatre, large or small, that is looking for a challenge.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/pacific-overtures-original-broadway-cast-recording/366551472	https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/55/52/7d/mzi.vxbdujpd.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

286	Parade	Jason Robert Brown	Jason Robert Brown	Amid religious intolerance, political injustice and racial tension, the stirring Tony Award-winning Parade explores the endurance of love and hope against all the odds. With a book by acclaimed playwright Alfred Uhry (Driving Miss Daisy) and a rousing, colorful and haunting score by Jason Robert Brown (Songs For a New World, The Last Five Years, Bridges of Madison County), Parade is a moving examination of the darkest corners of America's history. In 1913, Leo Frank, a Brooklyn-raised Jew living in Georgia, is put on trial for the murder of thirteen-year-old Mary Phagan, a factory worker under his employ. Already guilty in the eyes of everyone around him, a sensationalist publisher and a janitor's false testimony seal Leo's fate. His only defenders are a governor with a conscience and, eventually, his assimilated Southern wife who finds the strength and love to become his greatest champion. Daring, innovative and bold, Parade is filled with soaring music and a heart-wrenching story, offering a moral lesson about the dangers of prejudice and ignorance that should not be forgotten. Groups looking for powerful, moving theatrical experiences will need to look no further than this unforgettable show.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/parade-original-broadway-cast-recording/258619831	https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/2d/0c/81/dj.suyljbce.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

Featuring the iconic songs, "I'm Flying," "I've Gotta Crow," "I Won't Grow Up" and "Never Never Land," and a rousing book full of magic, warmth and adventure, Peter Pan is the perfect show for the child in all of us... who dreamed of soaring high and never growing up.

289	Philemon	Harvey Schmidt	Tom Jones	Told with the distinct voice of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt (The Fantasticks and I Do! I Do!), the tragically triumphant tale of Philemon is the pair's most adventurous Broadway venture yet. In the third-century Roman Empire, Cockian the clown finds himself face-to-face with a rigid Commander who sentences him to death. In a particularly sticky situation, the Commander grants Cockian life... on one condition: he must impersonate the secretly executed Christian leader, Philemon, to obtain information that would enable the Roman Empire to capture and execute more Christians. Valuing his life, Cockian does the Commander's bidding. His traipse into espionage, however, becomes much more than a means to survive and shows Cockian what it means to love. With its minimal cast, orchestra and production requirements, Philemon capitalizes on the intimacy, imagination and mythic quality that characterizes this writing team's astounding body of work. This gem of a piece can captivate audiences in any venue; from the cozy black box to the massive music hall.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/philemon-original-cast-recording/1464918378	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music123/v4/40/87/46/408746fc-896c-e20f-e47b-0bce9534b155/632433350324.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
290	Pipe Dream	Richard Rodgers	Oscar Hammerstein II	From the pages of Steinbeck, the drifters and dropouts along Cannery Row spring to life in this uncommon story of love and hope. When Suzy, a homeless girl, is picked up for stealing food, she's taken in by Fauna, the big-hearted Madam of the Bear Flag Café (which is no café at all). Here she meets Doc, a carefree marine biologist, and soon romance is in the air. Rodgers & Hammerstein struck a new tone with Pipe Dream: warm and highly personal. It illuminates Rodgers & Hammerstein’s benevolence for outcasts who are infinitely capable of every emotion and longing felt by the more fortunate members of society.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/pipe-dream-original-cast-recording/347499131	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/9c/da/5e/mzi.nvuqtkpk.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

Winner of four 2013 Tony Awards including Best Musical Revival, this updated circus-inspired version of Pippin continues to captivate and appeal to the young at heart throughout the world. Heir to the Frankish throne, the young prince Pippin is in search of the secret to true happiness and fulfillment. He seeks it in the glories of the battlefield, the temptations of the flesh and the intrigues of political power (after disposing of his father, King Charlemagne the Great). In the end, though, Pippin finds that happiness lies not in extraordinary endeavors, but rather in the unextraordinary moments that happen every day. Equally poignant as a black box production or as a splashy, spectacle-driven extravaganza, Pippin's message is universal and will connect with audiences across the age spectrum.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/pippin-new-broadway-cast-recording/1269634124	https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/20/7a/c4/207ac4fa-5356-6c0f-c19a-c5e201210de6/791558947335.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

Drawing its title from a song in Sunday in the Park with George, it celebrates Sondheim's incomparable career in musical theatre.

With a bit of imagination, the guests transform the apartment into the stage of an abandoned theatre, an estate in Sweden, an island outside of Paris, a street off the Roman Forum, the woods of a fairy tale and a mythical town in the Southwest. This tribute in the form of a revue provides a wonderful opportunity for simple sets and costumes. Sondheim's music will allow performers to showcase their vocal and acting abilities.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/sondheim-putting-it-together-original-1993-off-broadway/286855525	https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/8f/94/72/mzi.xqqoiolr.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

With a soaring score that incorporates turn of the century themes with LaChiusa's signature complexity and insight, Queen of the Mist is the story of a single great fall, and how one woman risked death so that she could live.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/queen-of-the-mist-original-cast-recording/1342397055	https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/ec/87/0b/ec870b8d-3a72-4734-8fee-e5c59dd17e1c/791558946031.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

Doctorow's distinguished novel, Ragtime is the winner of the 1998 Tony Awards for Best Score, Book and Orchestrations, and both the Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle Awards for Best Musical and Best Score. Called by TIME Magazine "A triumph for the stage," and by the International Herald Tribune "the best musical in twenty years," this acclaimed musical is filled with pageantry, emotion and hope, bursting onto the stage like no other musical. At the dawn of a new century, everything is changing... and anything is possible. Set in the volatile melting pot of turn-of-the-century New York, three distinctly American tales are woven together – that of a stifled upper-class wife, a determined Jewish immigrant and a daring young Harlem musician – united by their courage, compassion and belief in the promise of the future. Together, they confront history's timeless contradictions of wealth and poverty, freedom and prejudice, hope and despair... and what it means to live in America. The Tony-winning score is just as diverse as the melting pot of America itself, drawing upon many musical styles, from the ragtime rhythms of Harlem and Tin Pan Alley to the klezmer of the Lower East Side, from bold brass band marches to delicate waltzes, from up-tempo banjo tunes to period parlor songs and expansive anthems. A truly unique and powerful portrait of America, Ragtime is sure to inspire actors and audiences alike!	https://music.apple.com/us/album/ragtime-the-musical-original-broadway-cast-recording-l/274487578	https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/84/3f/18/dj.dzulukrh.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

Smitten with Tom, Essie pretends to have been attacked by the murderer, as well, and hijinks ensue – complete with cunning disguises, spine-tingling chases and an ill-fated show at the Odeon Musical Hall! With a large ensemble cast, Redhead has a variety of great roles for a strong chorus, in addition to a star turn for a "triple-threat" lead actress. The winning, Golden Age score featuring toe-tapping melodies by Albert Hague and witty, memorable lyrics by Dorothy Fields, paired with the heavy dance component, make this show a surefire crowd-pleaser.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/redhead-original-broadway-cast-recording/337720292	https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/c2/5d/db/mzi.jvbizkcu.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

You won't be able to resist the spoofy fun of Reefer Madness. The addictive, clever musical numbers range from big Broadway-style showstoppers to swing tunes like 'Down at the Ol' Five and Dime' and the Vegas-style 'Listen to Jesus, Jimmy,' featuring J.C.

309	Rocky	Stephen Flaherty	Lynn Ahrens	Rocky  is a 2012 musical with music and lyrics by Tony® winners and Academy Award® nominees Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens, and a book by multiple Tony winner Thomas Meehan, adapted from the acclaimed Oscar®-nominated screenplay by Sylvester Stallone. The show had its world premiere in Hamburg in 2012 and opened on Broadway in 2014 at the Winter Garden Theatre. The musical follows the plot of the Academy Award-winning Best Picture classic, Rocky. Rocky  brings to life the story of Rocky Balboa, a small-time boxer from working-class Philadelphia, who is chosen to take on the reigning world heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed, when the undefeated fighter's scheduled opponent is injured. While training with former bantamweight contender Mickey, Rocky tentatively begins a relationship with Adrian, the wallflower sister of his meat-packer pal Paulie. They establish a touching rapport, especially in the scenes featuring Rocky's efforts to coax Adrian out of her own shell. Because Rocky really is a tender love story camouflaged under a burly exterior, Ahrens' and Flaherty's beautiful and energized score includes two moving duets for Rocky and Adrian, while the book explores the depths and complexity of their relationship.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/rocky-broadway-original-broadway-cast-recording/1443200296	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/8c/89/33/8c89335c-11a6-d7ab-df6b-32dd0eea70a2/00602537847099.rgb.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
310	Romance/Romance	Keith Herrmann	Barry Harman	Two one act musicals take varied looks at romance seekers. The first is a delightful romp through the sexual ennui of turn of the century Vienna based on Schnitzler's tale The Little Comedy. Act 2 is a modern look at affection and disaffection in a two couple summer house in the Hamptons based on the Jules Renard play Summer Share. An Off Off Broadway sensation that successfully moved to Broadway, Romance/Romance is a perfect change from the modern mega musical.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/weird-romance-original-off-broadway-cast-recording/403757623	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/45/48/ab/mzi.hoelfmkz.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
311	Rothschild & Sons	Jerry Bock	Sheldon Harnick	With a score by Tony Award winners Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock (Fiddler on the Roof, She Loves Me), Rothschild & Sons tells the tale of the Rothschild family, who built a business empire from nothing in the face of adversity and bigotry. But above all, Rothschild & Sons is a one-act epic about faith, persistance, and how family gives the greatest wealth of all. Shrewd, charismatic, resourceful and ambitious, Mayer Rothschild and his five sons struggle to overcome the prejudice of late-eighteenth-century European society, as they build a family banking business that takes them from the Jewish ghetto to the courts of the rich and powerful. On the way, they come to dominate European finance, help fund Napoleon's defeat and secure a Declaration of Rights for their people from the Crowned Heads of State. It is truly Europe's most famous rags-to-riches story. Powerful and informative in nature, Rothschild & Sons, much like Fiddler on the Roof, is an impactful, important, and must-see piece for all audiences. Requiring most actors to play multiple roles, it creates ample opportunities to feature an array of talented actor-singers who will love sinking their teeth into the ambitious and bold libretto/score.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/rothschild-sons-original-off-broadway-cast/1119181138	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music18/v4/df/05/ff/df05ff4a-0993-900e-e21e-047bb8c0dbb4/Rothschild_Cover1.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
312	Sandy Wilson's The Boy Friend	Sandy Wilson	Sandy Wilson	The Jazz Age lives on in Sandy Wilson's The Boy Friend, a light romantic spoof of 1920s musical comedy. Written in the fifties as "a new musical of the twenties," this is still considered the most successful and witty of the send-up musicals. Set against the backdrop of the French Riviera, this romantic spoof of 1920s musical comedies tells the story of English heiress, Polly, who is longing for only one thing: a boy friend. Polly's father, convinced that any boy who isn't wealthy will court Polly strictly for her financial situation, forbids her to engage any potential suitors. Honoring his wishes, Polly explains to Tony, the messenger boy with whom she's fallen in love, that she is no rich girl. This is just the tip of the mistaken identity iceberg, as love proceeds to find its way charmingly through nearly every member of the cast and bring them all to a happy ending. The Boy Friend is an essential Golden Age musical. Filled to the brim with tongue-in-cheek moments that both parents and grandparents will love, The Boy Friend has a catchy score and opportunities for complex dance numbers. With a fair amount of featured actor/actress roles, it's also an unforgettable chance to showcase a comedic and cheery talent pool.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-boy-friend-original-broadway-cast-recording/272094221	https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/3d/8e/8f/dj.kwnawobm.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
313	Saturday Night	Stephen Sondheim	Stephen Sondheim	In 1953, Saturday Night was to mark the Broadway debut of a young, new writer named Stephen Sondheim. Owing to the death of the original producer, Saturday Night's New York opening was delayed some 47 years! But now it's here, brimming with all of the charm and youthful vitality of a talent blossoming into greatness. Saturday Night tells the unassuming story of a group of Brooklyn boys, trying to make good in the stock market in 1929. Unfortunately, one of them, Gene, is so eager to climb the social ladder and impress his sweetheart that he invests his friends' money in a swank apartment near the Brooklyn Bridge, even going so far as to sell the gang's precious automobile! Based on a play by two brothers who were responsible for the classic film, Casablanca, Saturday Night features a fetching, tuneful Broadway-style score that hints at Sondheim's triumphs-to-come while staying firmly rooted in the Rodgers and Hammerstein tradition. Saturday Night is a nostalgic charmer that will appeal to every audience and is a must for Sondheim fans.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/saturday-night-original-cast-recording/98431408	https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/0e/c1/fe/mzi.nyscxigv.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpg
314	Say, Darling	Jule Styne	Betty Comden and Adolph Green	Say, Darling is a three-act, behind-the-scenes comedy about the creation of a Broadway musical. Inspired by Richard Bissell's semi-autobiographical novel, which chronicled his experience in transferring his novel 7½ Cents into The Pajama Game, Say, Darling is more "straight play with music" than "traditional book musical." Each of the eleven original songs by Jule Styne, Betty Comden, and Adolph Green is sung within the context of the show the characters are rehearsing. Say, Darling opened on Broadway at the ANTA Playhouse on April 3, 1958, starring Vivian Blaine, David Wayne, Johnny Desmond and Robert Morse. The show later transferred to the Martin Beck Theatre, playing a total of 332 performances.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/say-darling-original-broadway-cast-recording/451264954	https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/57/8b/7c/mzi.focwqvfn.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

318	Seussical	Stephen Flaherty	Lynn Ahrens	Now one of the most performed shows in America, Seussical is a fantastical, magical, musical extravaganza! Tony winners, Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty (Lucky Stiff, My Favorite Year, Once on This Island, Ragtime), have lovingly brought to life all of our favorite Dr. Seuss characters, including Horton the Elephant, The Cat in the Hat, Gertrude McFuzz, lazy Mayzie and a little boy with a big imagination – Jojo. The colorful characters transport us from the Jungle of Nool to the Circus McGurkus to the invisible world of the Whos. The Cat in the Hat tells the story of Horton, an elephant who discovers a speck of dust that contains the Whos, including Jojo, a Who child sent off to military school for thinking too many "thinks." Horton faces a double challenge: not only must he protect the Whos from a world of naysayers and dangers, but he must guard an abandoned egg, left in his care by the irresponsible Mayzie La Bird. Although Horton faces ridicule, danger, kidnapping and a trial, the intrepid Gertrude McFuzz never loses faith in him. Ultimately, the powers of friendship, loyalty, family and community are challenged and emerge triumphant. Seussical is fun for the whole family! Performers of all ages will be excited to portray the characters from the familiar Dr. Seuss fables. This musical provides wonderful creative opportunities for set, lighting and costume design.

320	She Loves Me	Jerry Bock	Sheldon Harnick	An intimate and touching show, featuring music by Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick (Fiddler on the Roof) and book by Joe Masteroff (Cabaret), She Loves Me was nominated for five Tony Awards in 1964. The 1993 Broadway revival won the Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival, the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Musical and the 1994 Critics Circle Award for Best Musical. Considered by many to be the most charming musical ever written, She Loves Me is a warm romantic comedy with an endearing innocence and a touch of old world elegance. Set in a 1930s European perfumery, we meet shop clerks, Amalia and Georg, who, more often than not, don't see eye to eye. After both respond to a "lonely hearts advertisement" in the newspaper, they now live for the love letters that they exchange, but the identity of their admirers remains unknown. Join Amalia and Georg to discover the identity of their true loves... and of all the twists and turns along the way! She Loves Me showcases a small but strong ensemble cast playing a range of memorable characters of all ages.

321	SHOUT! The Mod Musical	Various	Various	With its irresistible blend of hip-swiveling hits, eye-popping fashions and outrageous dance moves, SHOUT! The Mod Musical takes audiences back to the music, style and freedom of the 1960s. Created by Phillip George and David Lowenstein, SHOUT! features terrific new arrangements of such classic tunes as "To Sir with Love," "Downtown," "Son of a Preacher Man" and "Goldfinger." The review follows five groovy gals as they come of age during those glorious days that made England swing. Traveling in time from 1960 to 1970, SHOUT! chronicles the dawning liberation of women, from the rise of Dusty Springfield, Petula Clark and Cilla Black as independent women with major careers, to their American counterparts, redefining themselves in the face of changing attitudes about gender. With a shimmy and shake, the songs are tied together by hilarious sound bites from the period – from '60s advertisements to letters answered by an advice columnist who thinks that every problem can be solved with a "fetching new hair style and a new shade of lipstick." The songs in this delightful musical resonate with a timeless quality that appeals to every generation. A wonderful choice to showcase strong, female talent at any community theatre, high school or college.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/shout-original-cast-recording-the-mod-musical-soundtrack/202964056	https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/30/f6/e5/mzi.imcscnxk.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
322	Show Boat	Jerome Kern	Oscar Hammerstein II	Spanning the years from 1880 to 1927, this lyrical masterpiece concerns the lives, loves and heartbreaks of three generations of show folk on the Mississippi, in Chicago and on Broadway (and their lifelong friends). The primary plot follows Magnolia, the naive daughter of the show boat captain, as she marries a gambler and moves with him to Chicago. His gambling continues as his debts compound, and soon he deserts her and their young daughter. A subplot concerns the potential arrest of Magnolia's selfless best friend on charges of miscegenation when it's discovered that she is of mixed race, and her subsequent downward spiral into despair. The passing of time reunites Magnolia and her now-grown daughter with her family on the show boat as well as with her husband, who eventually returns offering a hopeful second chance at familial fulfillment.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/showboat-original-cast-rsc-opera-north-production-first/204084992	https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/2e/d3/03/mzi.olgwfrvz.tif/1000x1000bb.jpeg

Shrek brings all the beloved characters you know from the film to life on stage and proves there's more to the story than meets the ears. "Once upon a time, there was a little ogre named Shrek...." And thus begins the tale of an unlikely hero who finds himself on a life-changing journey alongside a wisecracking Donkey and a feisty princess who resists her rescue. Throw in a short-tempered bad guy, a cookie with an attitude and over a dozen other fairy tale misfits, and you've got the kind of mess that calls for a real hero. Luckily, there's one on hand... and his name is Shrek. Shrek presents a treasure trove of creative opportunities, including costumes, sets, puppets (there is a fire-breathing dragon after all) and more!

Now, with this award-winning revue of his earlier work, some of the most lush, unforgettable songs from this musical theatre master are presented in one magical evening.

In silent movies, Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont are a hot item but, behind the scenes, things aren't always as they appear on the big screen!

330	Smoke on the Mountain	Connie Ray, Alan Bailey, Mike Craver, Mark Hardwick	Connie Ray, Alan Bailey, Mike Craver, Mark Hardwick	Smoke on the Mountain tells the story of a Saturday Night Gospel Sing at a country church in North Carolina’s Smoky Mountains in 1938. The show features two dozen rousing bluegrass songs played and sung by the Sanders Family, a traveling group making its return to performing after a five-year hiatus. Pastor Oglethorpe, the young and enthusiastic minister of Mount Pleasant Baptist Church, has enlisted the Sanders Family in his efforts to bring his tiny congregation into “the modern world.” Between songs, each family member “witnesses” – telling a story about an important event in their life. Though they try to appear perfect in the eyes of a congregation who wants to be inspired by their songs, one thing after another goes awry and they reveal their true – and hilariously imperfect – natures. By the evening’s end, the Sanders Family have endeared themselves to us by revealing their weaknesses and allowing us to share in their triumphs.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/smoke-on-the-mountain/194526044	https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/32/5f/fe/mzi.dmhbljsp.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpg

333	Something Rotten!	Karey Kirkpatrick	Karey Kirkpatrick	Welcome to the Renaissance and the outrageous, crowd-pleasing musical farce, Something Rotten.  Created by Grammy Award-winning songwriter Wayne Kirkpatrick, and successful screenwriters Karey Kirkpatrick and John O’Farrell, Something Rotten was lauded by audience members and critics alike, receiving several Best Musical nominations and hailed by Time Out New York as "the funniest musical comedy in at least 400 years". Set in the 1590s, brothers Nick and Nigel Bottom are desperate to write a hit play but are stuck in the shadow of that Renaissance rock star known as "The Bard." When a local soothsayer foretells that the future of theatre involves singing, dancing and acting at the same time, Nick and Nigel set out to write the world’s very first musical. But amidst the scandalous excitement of opening night, the Bottom Brothers realize that reaching the top means being true to thine own self, and all that jazz. Something Rotten features large song and dance numbers, and a wacky cast of over-the-top characters, each given his or her own special moment in the show to shine.  Throughout its Broadway run, the musical received a show-stopping standing ovation from audiences... in the beginning of the first act!  It’s become clear that “nothing’s as amazing as a musical,” so don’t miss your chance to bring this history-twisting tale to your stage.

334	Something's Afoot	James Mc	James Mc	A zany, entertaining musical that takes a satirical poke at Agatha Christie mysteries and musical styles of the English music hall of the ’30s. Ten people are stranded in an isolated English country house during a raging thunderstorm. One by one they’re picked off by cleverly fiendish devices. As the bodies pile up in the library, the survivors frantically race to uncover the identity and motivation of the cunning culprit.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/somethings-afoot-world-premiere-studio-cast/1504884235	https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music113/v4/72/65/66/726566ec-7c6c-7567-d4aa-0e0029602398/Somethings_Afoot_Cover_Scan.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
335	Sondheim on Sondheim	Stephen Sondheim	Stephen Sondheim	Hailed as a "revelatory revue full of wonderful moments" and a "funny, affectionate and revealing tribute to musical theater's greatest living composer and lyricist," Sondheim on Sondheim is an intimate portrait of the famed songwriter in his own words... and music. Through the use of exclusive interview footage, audiences get an inside look at the personal life and artistic process of famed composer, Stephen Sondheim. His story. His inspiration. His genius. The tapestry of creativity that characterizes Stephen Sondheim remained largely undiscussed, especially by the man himself, until the creation of Sondheim on Sondheim. Ranging from the beloved to the obscure, the carefully selected two-dozen songs hang from a framework of in-depth video interviews, delving into Sondheim's personal life and artistic process. Far from the typical song cycle, Sondheim on Sondheim has massive theatrical potency, as well as inarguable staying power. The incomparable James Lapine brilliantly curated a collection of songs that have been masterfully arranged by David Loud. In addition, Sondheim on Sondheim's multimedia facets make it equally at home on a Broadway-sized stage as it would be in a black box space. Included in the rehearsal set for Sondheim on Sondheim is the video content required for the show. This video content is supplied on an external hard drive that includes a single-channel video playback system and all 100 required video segments. The rehearsal set also includes a video playback instruction guide and cue sheet. Please note the video playback system can ONLY be used on Macs.

These are the stories and characters of today, the Songs for a New World. The first musical from Tony Award winner, Jason Robert Brown (Parade, Bridges of Madison County), this moving collection of powerful songs examines life, love and the choices that we make.

339	South Pacific	Richard Rodgers	Oscar Hammerstein II	Nellie, a spunky nurse from Arkansas, falls in love with a mature French planter, Emile. Nellie learns that the mother of his children was an island native and, unable to turn her back on the prejudices with which she was raised, refuses Emile's proposal of marriage. Meanwhile, the strapping Lt. Joe Cable denies himself the fulfillment of a future with an innocent Tonkinese girl with whom he's fallen in love out of the same fears that haunt Nellie. When Emile is recruited to accompany Joe on a dangerous mission that claims Joe's life, Nellie realizes that life is too short not to seize her own chance for happiness, thus confronting and conquering her prejudices.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/south-pacific-original-broadway-cast-recording/193001294	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/73/31/a2/mzi.lkorhxlp.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

341	Spring Awakening	Duncan Sheik	Steven Sater	The winner of eight Tony Awards, including Best Musical, told by Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater through what Entertainment Weekly called, "the most gorgeous Broadway score this decade," Spring Awakening explores the journey from adolescence to adulthood with a poignancy and passion that is illuminating and unforgettable. The landmark musical is an electrifying fusion of morality, sexuality and rock and roll that is exhilarating audiences across the nation like no other musical in years. It is Germany, 1891, a world where the grown-ups hold all the cards. The beautiful young Wendla explores the mysteries of her body and wonders aloud where babies come from... until Mama tells her to shut it and put on a proper dress. Elsewhere, the brilliant and fearless young Melchior interrupts a mind-numbing Latin drill to defend his buddy, Moritz – a boy so traumatized by puberty that he can't concentrate on anything... not that the Headmaster cares. He strikes them both and tells them to turn in their lesson. One afternoon, in a private place in the woods, Melchior and Wendla meet by accident and soon find within themselves a desire unlike anything they've ever felt. As they fumble their way into one another's arms, Moritz flounders and soon fails out of school. When even his one adult friend, Melchior's mother, ignores his plea for help, he is left so distraught that he can't hear the promise of life offered by his outcast friend, Ilse. Naturally, the Headmasters waste no time in pinning the "crime" of Moritz's suicide on Melchior to expel him. And soon, Mama learns that her little Wendla is pregnant. Now the young lovers must struggle against all odds to build a world together for their child. This celebration of rebellion provides the perfect opportunity to feature performers of all types, as well as the creative flexibility with the use of costumes, set pieces and lighting. Featuring a pop rock score, this is an ideal show for talented vocalists with strong acting abilities. Join this group of late nineteenth century German students on their passage as the navigate teenage self-discovery and coming of age anxiety in a powerful celebration of youth and rebellion in the daring, remarkable Spring Awakening.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/spring-awakening-feat-steven-sater/1440732230	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music118/v4/7a/4a/2c/7a4a2c38-beb4-a4b6-a62c-787caabd1717/00602517201002.rgb.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

343	Starting Here, Starting Now	David Shire	Richard Maltby, Jr.	Starting Here, Starting Now is a thrilling and touching musical revue using the songs of Richard Maltby, Jr., and David Shire (Big, Baby, Closer Than Ever). In only 24 songs, Starting Here, Starting Now offers a tender-tough inventory of love and the lonesome lack thereof. Made for each other, the wry lyrics of Richard Maltby, Jr., combined with David Shire‘s buoyant music, forge a fast-moving, ingratiating look at how love can go right, wrong or nowhere. Using songs from their various early musicals (produced or otherwise), this bold, extroverted journey takes a winsome cast of three through the maze of modern relationships with its heart firmly on its sleeve. As with all of Maltby and Shire's work, each song is an impeccably crafted story – original, engaging, bursting with character and showcasing the versatility and charisma of its performer. From tender ballads to hysterical husband-hunting laments, from wry comments on trendy marriages to ecstatic shouting-from-the-rooftop celebration, Starting Here, Starting Now has an appealing freshness that has made it a perennial favorite throughout the world.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/starting-here-starting-now-original-cast-recording/575798753	https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/06/cb/0c/06cb0cfd-0322-6a16-7dc7-6375215750dd/dj.hraqpwaa.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
344	Steel Pier	John Kander and Fred Ebb	John Kander and Fred Ebb	In the honky tonk world of marathon dancing in Atlantic City in 1933, a captivating assortment of depression era souls eager to dance their way into fame and prizes gather on the Steel Pier. The spectacle is presided over by an oily tongued emcee who is secretly married to Rita Racine, the champion dancer. Her usual partner doesn't show up, so she is paired with a handsome pilot on leave. As the hours of dancing whirl on, Rita becomes increasingly disillusioned with her sleazy, conniving husband and more and more infatuated with the handsome young aviator and a vision of life in a peaceful cottage. Songs by the creators of Chicago, Cabaret and other Broadway classics perfectly capture the rhythms of the 1930's dance era.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/steel-pier-original-broadway-cast-recording/254830089	https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/8d/70/06/mzi.nbezzugz.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

347	Strike up the Band	George Gershwin	Ira Gershwin	The hilarity of Strike up the Band proves that "all is farcical in love and war!" with this romp; a true joy embodied on the stage. With music by George Gershwin, lyrics by Ira Gershwin and script by George S. Kaufman, this Broadway classic offers songs ranging from playful Gilbert and Sullivan pastiches to heart-clutching ballads (most notably "The Man I Love"), woven into a goofy plot that is loaded with blatant anti-war, big-business satire. The overly proud owner of the Fletcher American Cheese Co. has convinced the U.S. government to declare war on Switzerland, who has protested a tariff on imported cheese. Add two pairs of star-crossed lovers, one very overbearing mother, a cagey government official and a strange man who always places himself in the right place at the most interesting times; mix them all together, and you are left with a side-splitting romp of cheese-y proportions! Beneath this title's exterior beats an observant heart that is as relevant today as when it opened. The magnificence of its Gershwin score is sheer splendor. Performers and audience members alike will be chomping at the bit and, given the brilliance of the material, it can be produced just as effectively as a concert piece.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/strike-up-the-band-2011-studio-cast-recording/640642290	https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/f2/94/2c/f2942cac-585b-4c47-7b81-4a59e0724872/803607110024_cover.tif/1000x1000bb.jpeg
348	Sunday in the Park with George	Stephen Sondheim	Stephen Sondheim	Inspired by the painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat, Sunday in the Park with George, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's stunning masterpiece, merges past and present into beautiful, poignant truths about life, love and the creation of art. One of the most acclaimed musicals of our time, this moving study of the enigmatic painter, Georges Seurat, won a Pulitzer Prize and was nominated for an astounding ten Tony Awards, including Best Musical. The days leading up to the completion of his most famous painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat is struggling to make meaningful art and maintaining a relationship with his lover, Dot. Amid the scorn of the artistic community, Seurat's artistic ability thrives while his love diminishes. A century later, Seurat's descendant – named George and also an artist – finds himself burnt out and in search of what artistic path to follow, but he finds the answer to his future in the past. An ensemble of strong singing actors performs this challenging and heartbreaking work about our need to connect to the past, present and future. Sunday in the Park with George features two coveted starring roles made famous by the Broadway performances of Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters. The show may be staged simply, as in its original workshop production, or with the grandeur of Seurat's masterpiece.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/sunday-in-the-park-with-george-2017-broadway-cast-recording/1287258612	https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/12/98/24/129824b9-81c2-0487-990e-fcba82cfe2db/093624909378.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

350	Sweeney Todd	Stephen Sondheim	Stephen Sondheim	Sweeney Todd has become a bloody, worldwide success since being awarded eight Tony's, (including Best Musical), for its Broadway premiere. Stephen Sondheim's and Hugh Wheeler's (A Little Night Music, Pacific Overtures) tasty, thrilling, theatrical treat has simultaneously shocked, awed and delighted audiences across the world. An infamous tale, Sweeney Todd, an unjustly exiled barber, returns to nineteenth century London, seeking vengeance against the lecherous judge who framed him and ravaged his young wife. The road to revenge leads Todd to Mrs. Lovett, a resourceful proprietress of a failing pie shop, above which, he opens a new barber practice. Mrs. Lovett's luck sharply shifts when Todd's thirst for blood inspires the integration of an ingredient into her meat pies that has the people of London lining up... and the carnage has only just begun!

355	Tenderloin	Jerry Bock	Sheldon Harnick	Set in New York at the turn-of-the-century, the Tony-nominated Tenderloin reunited the authors, director and producers of the Pulitzer Prize-winning smash-hit, Fiorello! The sparkling, youthful score by Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock (Fiddler on the Roof, She Loves Me) stayed on the Billboard charts for 34 weeks when the original cast album was released. Dr. Brock is a crusading Minister who has dedicated himself to cleaning up the section of New York devoted to vice, the area known as the "Tenderloin". The "do-gooder," Reverend Brock, is aided by a reporter, Tommy Howatt, with a hidden agenda of his own. Brock is unaware that Tommy, his supposed associate, is in league with a dishonest policeman, Lieutenant Schmidt. The two of them frame Brock with doctored photographs. In court, though, Tommy – who has been converted to religion by a choir girl named Laura – admits the truth. A cleanup of the area begins. Brock doesn't remain to witness the change – he moves his campaign on to Detroit. Described as a "gay nineties" Guys and Dolls, Tenderloin is a must-produce for any theatre looking to produce Golden-Age Broadway musicals. A big, rousing, somewhat-risqué show with lots of dancing and the hit songs, "Artificial Flowers," "Little Old New York" and "Good Clean Fun," Tenderloin is a vintage show that still packs quite a punch.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/tenderloin-original-broadway-cast/716194901	https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/47/39/dd/4739dde3-4b7a-cd5c-1271-a44b5ddf2aa7/05099923763852.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

357	The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee	William Finn	William Finn	Winner of the Tony and the Drama Desk Awards for Best Book, The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee has charmed audiences across the country with its effortless wit and humor. Featuring a fast-paced, wildly funny and touching book by Rachel Sheinkin and a truly fresh and vibrant score by William Finn, this bee is one unforgettable experience. An eclectic group of six mid-pubescents vie for the spelling championship of a lifetime. While candidly disclosing hilarious and touching stories from their home lives, the tweens spell their way through a series of (potentially made-up) words, hoping never to hear the soul-crushing, pout-inducing, life un-affirming "ding" of the bell that signals a spelling mistake. Six spellers enter; one speller leaves! At least the losers get a juice box.

358	The Apple Tree	Jerry Bock	Jerry Bock	The brilliant songwriting team behind Fiddler on the Roof and She Loves Me bring us another witty, tuneful and utterly charming musical in The Apple Tree. The original production was directed by Mike Nichols and helped launch the career of Barbara Harris, who won a Tony for her role. The Apple Tree is made up of three musical miniatures that can be presented separately, or in any combination, to fill out a theatrical evening. "The Diary of Adam and Eve" is a quirky, touching spin on the tale of the world's first couple, adapted from Mark Twain's Extracts from Adam's Diary. "The Lady or the Tiger?" is a rock and roll fable set in a mythical barbarian kingdom, which explores the fickleness of love. "Passionella" is based on Jules Feiffer's offbeat Cinderella-story about a chimney sweep whose dreams of being a "glamorous movie star" nearly sabotage her one chance for true love. The Apple Tree is the perfect star vehicle for a woman and a man. Modest in its production requirements, this small cast show soars with Bock and Harnick's trademark warmth and humanity, amidst tongue-in-cheek humor.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-apple-tree-original-broadway-cast-recording/211380941	https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/e0/59/81/dj.iyodviaw.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

372	The Frogs	Stephen Sondheim	Stephen Sondheim	From the writers behind A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum comes the hilarious send up of Greek comedy and satire, The Frogs. Loosely based on a comedy written in 405 B.C. by Aristophanes, The Frogs playfully explores the great challenges of human existence: confronting our fears, understanding life and death and challenging the distractions that can prevent us from achieving our goals. This boisterously hilarious, yet poignant, musical follows Dionysos, Greek god of wine and drama, and his slave, Xanthias, on a journey to Hades to collect renowned critic and playwright, George Bernard Shaw, so that he may enlighten the easily misled and coerced masses of Earth. Along this journey, Dionysus and Xanthias meet Chekhov, Congreve, Ibsen, Brecht and, of course, the chorus of frogs. Then, Shakespeare shows up and starts declaiming his greatest hits; before long, he engages in a battle of words with Mr. Shaw. Who will win the honor of becoming reincarnated: The Bard or Bernard? The Frogs stays true to its heritage, mixing Aristophanic pratfall satire with a Sondheim score that swings from witty to pretty to rambunctious, but it also mirrors the Greek original for the serious issue of the role of the arts in a world beset by war and folly. This musical is ideal for a regional theatre looking to inject a bit of Greek satire into its season.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-year-with-frog-and-toad-original-cast-recording/571088394	https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/17/b8/35/17b83565-da46-e3d9-d93d-4d0e053fb651/803607041625_cover.tif/1000x1000bb.jpeg

Your heart will be warmed by this May-to-December romance, when a city bride is wooed by an aging Italian grape farmer who nearly botches everything... until his true goodness shines through. With a gorgeous score and spirited dancing, it's a simple and touching love story that makes for an extraordinary night of theatre. Tony, a middle-aged vintner, makes a mail order marriage proposal, which is accepted under the girl's mistaken assumption that a photo of his young, handsome foreman is her intended husband. Her hurt and humiliation when she learns the truth, as well as a terrible accident that nearly kills Tony as he hurries to meet her, almost ends the relationship before it begins, but a loving understanding blossoms between them during Tony's long convalescence. Filled with sweeping ballads, intense dramatic arias and tuneful, splashy Broadway-style numbers, this ambitious "Broadway opera" has found a home on opera and musical-theatre stages alike. Its sizable score showcases strong singers, including a mature operatic baritone and a young soprano ingénue for the two lead roles. The rest of the large cast consists of a winsome comic duo for the secondary leads and a host of other compelling characters. The show's lasting popularity has led to two Broadway revivals, the latter with a two-piano accompaniment that is available for rental.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-most-happy-fella-original-broadway-cast-recording/483035130	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/d6/72/04/mzi.wgfxtzlu.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

394	The Pajama Game	Jerry Ross	Jerry Ross	The Pajama Game was awarded the 1955 Tony for Best Musical and, over half of a century later, claimed the award for Best Revival of a Musical, proving that the story is truly timeless. With an energetic score by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross (Damn Yankees), The Pajama Game is brimming with songs and dances that have become musical theatre standards, including "Steam Heat" and "Hernando's Hideaway."

395	The People vs. Friar Laurence, The Man Who Killed Romeo and Juliet	Ron West, Phil Swann	Ron West, Phil Swann	The People Vs. Friar Laurence, The Man Who Killed Romeo and Juliet is the Romeo and Juliet story told from the perspective of Friar Laurence. It was created using the following formula: Troubled teenagers + feuding families + political intrigue = musical comedy.  The show, a smash hit for Chicago Shakespeare Theater, is the funniest mash up of Shakespeare, Gilbert & Sullivan, sketch comedy, and American theater you've ever seen.IMPORTANT: While all audiences will enjoy the play, it includes some strong language some producers may be uncomfortable with, so the authors have provided an appendix to the script wherein the coarser language has been redacted.The People vs. Friar Laurence was first presented by David Castellani at the Tamarind Theater in Los Angeles in January 2004. It was subsequently presented by Chicago Shakespeare Theater in May 2004. The cast included Nicole Parker (Mad-TV, Wicked), Keegan-Michael Key (Key and Peele), and Brian Gallivan (Sassy Gay Friend).	https://music.apple.com/us/album/people-vs-friar-laurence-man-who-killed-romeo-juliet/57661626	https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/y2005/m04/d12/h13/s05.iddsdhqn.tif/1000x1000bb.jpeg

She is accused of killing C.C. Katt, recording studio operator and her husband of ten hours, by hitting him over the head with her Stratocaster guitar. She is defended by Jim Summerford, a Southern gentleman who’s never won a case against prosecutor and Mayoral candidate Mavis Frye—his fiancé. As Jim tries to prove Mona’s innocence, he becomes attracted to her, and Mavis ups the stakes: she wants to convict Mona, marry Jim, take office, tear down the Frog Pad, and put up a Casino—bringing in bucks, but taking away Tippo’s artistic and social traditions in the process. And if Mona is found guilty, the odds are Mavis will get her way.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/people-vs-mona-original-cast-recording-york-theatre/328170133	https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/f5/50/8b/mzi.lnwdhfpa.tif/1000x1000bb.jpeg

398	The Pirates of Penzance	W.S. Gilbert, Arthur Sullivan, Peter Murray	W.S. Gilbert, Arthur Sullivan, Peter Murray	Gilbert and Sullivan are the undisputed masters of comic operetta and the proud parents of the modern musical. That their works are more in demand today than when they were created over a century ago is ample proof of their lasting brilliance. When the hero of The Pirates of Penzance was but a boy, his father instructed his nurse to have him apprenticed as a pilot. She thought he said 'pirate' and thus the zany troubles began.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-pirates-of-penzance-original-cast-recording/268824831	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/09/fb/4b/mzi.cifpaiyn.tif/1000x1000bb.jpeg

400	The Producers	Mel Brooks	Mel Brooks	Bialystock and Bloom! Those names should strike terror and hysteria in anyone familiar with Mel Brooks' classic cult comedy film. Now as a big Broadway musical, The Producers once again sets the standard for modern, outrageous, in-your-face humor. It is a truly "boffo" hit, winning a record twelve Tony Awards and wowing capacity crowds night after night. The plot is simple: a down-on-his-luck Broadway producer and his mild-mannered accountant come up with a scheme to produce the most notorious flop in history, thereby bilking their backers (all "little old ladies") out of millions of dollars. Only one thing goes awry: the show is a smash hit! The antics of Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom as they maneuver their way fecklessly through finding a show (the gloriously offensive "Springtime for Hitler"), hiring a director, raising the money and finally going to prison for their misdeeds is a lesson in broad comic construction. At the core of the insanely funny adventure is a poignant emotional journey of two very different men who become friends. With a truly hysterical book co-written by Mel Brooks and Thomas Meehan (Annie) and music and lyrics by Mr. Brooks, The Producers skewers Broadway traditions and takes no prisoners as it proudly proclaims itself an "equal opportunity offender!"	https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-producers-original-broadway-cast-recording/357911384	https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/ef/ab/5f/mzi.oypkcner.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
401	The Ragged Child	David Nield	Frank Whately	Broadcast on the BBC in 1988, The Ragged Child became a flagship production and title for the UK's National Youth Music Theatre. Critics have largely hailed The Ragged Child as "moving" and "stirring." The dire straits of the poor and destitute of 1850's London is mirrored in the tragic lives of siblings Joe & Annie Cooper. As they are fighting in the streets for survival and reprieve from the deadly cholera outbreak, Lord Shaftesbury is fighting in the House of Lords for the education of the ignorant, illiterate poor. As Lord Shaftesbury's quest has a successful outcome, the Coopers are not so lucky. They're the last of the unfortunate souls to slip through the fingers of necessary charity. The Ragged Child comes from a creative team that has a staggering number of musicals under its belt, including Drake, Tin Pan Ali and The Roman Invasion of Ramsbottom. It's a well-crafted tale that is the ideal choice for a theatre company that would like to feature young artists. The Ragged Child also has potential to couple well with schools' history curricula.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-ragged-child-original-nymt-london-cast-recording/539452597	https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/c4/34/c0/c434c0db-7a8b-cc26-43f0-ffe2c70e55ee/Cover.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

Anna Antonelli's roller rink is about to be demolished, and with it Anna's sour memories of her Lothario of a husband and her painfully shy daughter Angel. The rink becomes an arena in which mother and daughter examine their past, present and future.

Composer-lyricist Neil Bartram and librettist Brian Hill have created an authentic and affecting work, told through a series of songs – in turn playful, touching and dramatic. The Story of My Life inspires us to reconnect with those who were part of the earliest chapters of our own life stories. The Story of My Life follows the friendship of Alvin and Thomas, two men from a small town. These lifelong friends are reunited after Alvin's mysterious death. In the abstract world of his mind, Thomas struggles to write Alvin's eulogy while recounting the many turns that their lives have taken since meeting as children. Alvin searches through the manuscripts and stories in Thomas' mind to lead him on a journey of remembrance. Through music and song, these two friends recount their adventures, explore their past dissonance and ultimately discover what is at the base of every strong friendship... love. The Story of My Life features a unique cast of only two actors, which provides extremely specialized direction opportunities. This musical is perfect for an intimate space, whether it be a community theatre or a small college venue.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-story-of-my-life-original-broadway-cast-recording/644279802	https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/9b/b5/4b/9bb54b1f-c95d-2407-ea6c-9a7ea5c783ba/803607098124_cover.tif/1000x1000bb.jpeg

This high-spirited musical romp is a delightful valentine to the long-standing spirit of New York City and the people who seek to discover themselves there. Set in New York City in 1922, Thoroughly Modern Millie tells the story of young Millie Dillmount from Kansas, who comes to New York in search of a new life for herself. Her grand plan is to find a job as a secretary for a wealthy man and then marry him. However, her plan goes completely awry. The owner of her dingy hotel kidnaps young girls to sell to the Far East, her wealthy boss is slow in proposing marriage and the man she actually falls in love with doesn't have a dime to his name... or so he tells her. Filled with frisky flappers, dashing leading men and a dragon lady of a villainess that audiences will love to hate, Thoroughly Modern Millie is a perfectly constructed evening of madcap merriment.

443	Urinetown	Mark Hollmann	Mark Hollmann	Winner of three Tony Awards, three Outer Critics Circle Awards, two Lucille Lortel Awards and two Obie Awards, Urinetown is an hilarious musical satire of the legal system, capitalism, social irresponsibility, populism, bureaucracy, corporate mismanagement, municipal politics and musical theatre itself! Hilariously funny and touchingly honest, Urinetown provides a fresh perspective on one of America's greatest art forms. In a Gotham-like city, a terrible water shortage, caused by a 20-year drought, has led to a government-enforced ban on private toilets. The citizens must use public amenities, regulated by a single malevolent company that profits by charging admission for one of humanity's most basic needs. Amid the people, a hero decides that he's had enough and plans a revolution to lead them all to freedom! Inspired by the works of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill, Urinetown is an irreverently humorous satire in which no one is safe from scrutiny. Praised for reinvigorating the very notion of what a musical could be, Urinetown catapults the "comedic romp" into the new millennium with its outrageous perspective, wickedly modern wit and sustained ability to produce gales of unbridled laughter.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/urinetown-the-musical/298680046	https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/5f/19/dd/mzi.roleidhe.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

446	Violet	Jeanine Tesori	Brian Crawley	Winner of the Drama Critics' Circle Award and Lucille Lortel Award for Best Musical when it premiered Off-Broadway in 1997, and then on to a Tony-nominated Broadway debut in 2014 with a revised version, Violet is a moving musical featuring show-stopping anthems, ranging from American-roots to folk to gospel.  With a score from Tony-winning composer Jeanine Tesori (Caroline, or Change; Thoroughly Modern Millie; Shrek; Fun Home) and book and lyrics by the acclaimed Brian Crawley (A Little Princess), Violet is inspired by the short story, The Ugliest Pilgrim by Doris Betts, astounding critics and audiences alike in two separate decades. As a girl, Violet was struck by a wayward axe blade when her father was chopping wood, leaving her with a visible scar across her face. With enough money finally saved she's traveling across the Deep South in 1964 towards a miracle – the healing touch of a TV evangelist who will make her beautiful. Although she may not succeed in having the scar on her face healed, Violet is able to repair those scars that are lying deeper than her skin. On the way, she meets a young, African-American soldier whose love for her reaches far past her physical "imperfections." Violet is a powerhouse piece of theatre that needs no more than a few chairs and talented performers to take an audience's breath away. It is a must for companies that are dedicated to depicting moving stories onstage.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/violet-original-broadway-cast-recording/873243147	https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music4/v4/4a/d0/ae/4ad0aec3-3857-9fc7-99e2-30bcca3371dc/1176626.tif/1000x1000bb.jpeg

Brilliant innovators with humble roots, both were masters of self-invention who sacrificed everything to become the country’s first major female entrepreneurs. They were also fierce competitors whose fifty-year tug-of-war would give birth to an industry. From Fifth Avenue society to the halls of Congress, their rivalry was relentless and legendary – pushing both women to build international empires in a world dominated by men.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/war-paint-original-broadway-cast-recording/1235156376	https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/cf/26/29/cf262974-c498-ce80-c8b2-4c4e55c5e0fa/791558451535.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

451	West Side Story	Leonard Bernstein	Stephen Sondheim	From the first notes to the final breath, West Side Story is one of the most memorable musicals and greatest love stories of all time. Arthur Laurents' book remains as powerful, poignant and timely as ever. The score by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim are widely regarded as among the best ever written. The world's greatest love story takes to the streets in this landmark Broadway musical that is one of the theatre's finest accomplishments. Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is transported to modern-day New York City as two young, idealistic lovers find themselves caught between warring street gangs, the "American" Jets and the Puerto Rican Sharks. Their struggle to survive in a world of hate, violence and prejudice is one of the most innovative, heart-wrenching and relevant musical dramas of our time. Highlighting the talents of a young ensemble cast, West Side Story has found popularity in schools as well as professional theatres throughout the world. Its exciting, sophisticated score by Leonard Bernstein is often considered Broadway's finest, its songs a part of the nation's musical heritage. As originally staged by the legendary Jerome Robbins, the show is an impressive showcase for accomplished dancers (a guide featuring the original choreography is available for rental). And, with a reduced orchestration and transpositions on demand, this masterpiece is easier to mount than ever before!	https://music.apple.com/us/album/west-side-story-new-broadway-cast-recording-2009/316530985	https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/b9/c5/2a/b9c52ab2-5343-97d5-4bb9-f6679b6c0f01/V4HttpAssetRepositoryClient-ticket.ldmsizdb.jpg-7201712960429847873.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
452	What about Luv?	Howard Marren	Susan Birkenhead	Fetching melodies, razor-sharp lyrics and zinging one-liners are the order of the day in this brilliant adaptation of the hilarious tongue-in-cheek comedy about love, What about Luv? From Susan Birkenhead, the Tony-nominated writer behind Jelly's Last Jam and Triumph of Love, and based on the hit play by Murray Schisgal, comes this non-stop laugh-riot that will keep you guessing until the very end. It all takes place on the Brooklyn Bridge. Harry, despondent and depressed, is about to end it all by jumping, but his old school buddy, Milt (who also happens to be at the bridge that night – to kill his wife, Ellen) coaxes him off of the ledge. When neurotic Harry and brainy Ellen fall in love, allowing Milt to run off with the girl from the office, it looks like everything will turn out rosy. But one year later, Ellen no longer loves Harry, Milt wants his wife back, and – together – they plot Harry's demise on the same bridge where they'd saved his life. One thing leads to several others, and a very damp fur coat, neuroses, intrigue, passion, jealousy and a used paper bag all add up to one of the most hilarious small musicals ever written! What about Luv? features a small band, a unit set and great comic roles, making it an excellent choice for theatres that are looking to have a huge success with a smaller show.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/what-about-luv-original-premiere-cast/1509020282	https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music123/v4/77/0e/d1/770ed18d-7694-c6e2-1081-ffe63e93558f/605288209727.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

The show ran for 540 performances.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/what-makes-sammy-run-original-broadway-cast-recording/396207428	https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/4c/f8/71/mzi.ujezllyo.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
454	Where's Charley?	Frank Loesser	Frank Loesser	What do you get when two musical theatre masters, Frank Loesser and George Abbott, adapt one of the most successful farces of all time? Where's Charley?, a tuneful comedy classic that earned lead actor Ray Bolger (of Wizard of Oz fame) a Tony Award and launched Loesser's career (Guys and Dolls)! George Abbot's book preserves all of the laughs from the record-breaking play, Charlie's Aunt, upon which the show is based. Oxford University students Charley and Jack invite the young and winsome Kitty and Amy to lunch under the chaperoning eye of Donna Lucia, Charley's wealthy aunt (it is, after all, 1892). But when Donna Lucia doesn't show, a desperate Charley disguises himself as his aunt so that the young ladies can visit. Charley is unaware that they've brought a chaperone of their own: Amy's stuffy uncle, who promptly falls for Charley's aunt-like charms! When the real aunt shows up, it's all downhill from there: quick changes, fast-talking, marriage proposals, compromising situations and rowdy hilarity. Where's Charley? offers a star turn for a talented leading man amongst a medium-sized cast. Featuring Loesser's critically acclaimed, but fairly obscure, score, Where's Charley? is a chance to introduce audiences to a classic Golden Age musical that they'll love, but that they probably haven't already heard, while keeping the interest of die-hard fans.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/wheres-charley/691971194	https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music4/v4/af/e8/5b/afe85b44-245a-9c63-0765-a9b09c05fa57/724356507159.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

Tess Harding is a high-powered anchorwoman of a network TV morning news show. She makes some derogatory remarks about comic strips on the air and comes head-to-head with Sam Craig, a famous cartoonist who introduces a lampoon of Tess into his comic strip.

Compelling music and a rousing story make Zorba! an outstanding opportunity for musical theatre performers and audiences alike.Zorba! was first presented on Broadway at the Imperial Theatre in November 1968.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/zorba-original-broadway-cast-recording/715757070	https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/2b/02/62/2b0262f5-c75e-2299-cfa0-5fa055e6dcce/05099924215855.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
458	Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown	David Yazbek	David Yazbek	Gazpacho, anyone? A musical adaptation of Pedro Almodóvar's beloved film of the same name, Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown is the brainchild of the talented team behind Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. Preserving the unusual and exhilarating tone and style of the Oscar-nominated film, Women on the Verge will delight both fans of the film and newcomers to the raucous tale. Both touching and hilarious, Women on the Verge is a story about women and the men who pursue them... finding them, losing them, needing them and rejecting them. At the center is Pepa, whose friends and lovers are blazing a trail through 1980s Madrid. Along with Pepa, there's her missing (possibly philandering) lover, Ivan; his ex-wife of questionable sanity, Lucia; their son, Carlos; Pepa's friend, Candela  and her terrorist boyfriend; a power-suited lawyer; and a taxi driver who dispenses tissues, mints and advice in equal proportion. Mayhem and comic madness abound, balanced by the empathy and heart that are trademarks of Almodóvar's work. Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown has a small, ensemble cast with many featured roles for women. The upbeat, memorable score is great for trained singers, giving many actors an opportunity to shine. Perfect for companies looking for a zany, contemporary show with a built-in fan base.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/women-on-verge-nervous-breakdown-original-broadway/1306252487	https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/85/40/7c/85407cfa-9e93-46e3-e615-b841dd027ab3/791558944730.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

460	Xanadu	Jeff Lynne	Jeff Lynne	This Tony Award-nominated, hilarious, roller skating, musical adventure about following your dreams despite the limitations others set for you, rolls along to the original hit score composed by pop-rock legends, Jeff Lynne and John Farrar. Based on the Universal Pictures cult classic movie of the same title, which starred Olivia Newton-John and Gene Kelly, Xanadu is hilarity on wheels for adults, children and anyone who has ever wanted to feel inspired. Xanadu follows the journey of a magical and beautiful Greek muse, Kira, who descends from the heavens of Mount Olympus to Venice Beach, California in 1980 on a quest to inspire a struggling artist, Sonny, to achieve the greatest artistic creation of all time – the first ROLLER DISCO! (Hey, it's 1980!) But, when Kira falls into forbidden love with the mortal Sonny, her jealous sisters take advantage of the situation, and chaos abounds. Xanadu is a moving, electrifying tale of endless fun that will keep audiences in stitches while the original legendary, chart-topping tunes lift them out of their seats. With a small cast and limited design needs, this is a perfect choice for high schools and community theatres looking to have a bonafide 80s blast. You'll want to keep the music in your head and Xanadu in your heart... forever.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/xanadu-original-broadway-cast-recording/523750114	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/cc/cb/97/cccb979e-e1ee-a2c4-dbf3-4e376de47a54/803607085827_cover.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg

462	Young Frankenstein	Mel Brooks	Mel Brooks	From the creators of the record-breaking Broadway sensation, The Producers, comes this monster new musical comedy. The comedy genius, Mel Brooks, adapts his legendarily funny film into a brilliant stage creation – Young Frankenstein! Grandson of the infamous Victor Frankenstein, Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced "Fronk-en-steen") inherits his family's estate in Transylvania. With the help of a hunchbacked sidekick, Igor (pronounced "Eye-gore"), and a leggy lab assistant, Inga (pronounced normally), Frederick finds himself in the mad scientist shoes of his ancestors. "It's alive!" he exclaims as he brings to life a creature to rival his grandfather's. Eventually, of course, the monster escapes and hilarity continuously abounds. Every bit as relevant to audience members who will remember the original as it will be to newcomers, Young Frankenstein has all the of panache of the screen sensation with a little extra theatrical flair added. It will surely be the perfect opportunity for a production company to showcase an array of talents. With such memorable tunes as "The Transylvania Mania," "He Vas My Boyfriend" and "Puttin' on the Ritz," Young Frankenstein is scientifically proven, monstrously good entertainment.	https://music.apple.com/us/album/young-frankenstein-the-new-mel-brooks-musical/1440728422	https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music118/v4/ee/c9/35/eec93561-78c3-1450-5e1b-20f9ca240ec7/00602517599604.rgb.jpg/1000x1000bb.jpeg
